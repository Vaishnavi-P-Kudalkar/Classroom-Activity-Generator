🤖 Agentic Design Insight
The backend includes a modular design via ai_engine.py, where an agentic approach has been introduced. While the current task is atomic and relatively simple, the architecture is extensible and scalable for agentic workflows—where a single autonomous agent can manage and coordinate a series of sub-tasks to accomplish a high-level goal.

Think of the agent like a “broker” or “project manager” — capable of breaking down a large task into actionable steps, executing them iteratively, and synthesizing a coherent output.
This agentic setup becomes particularly powerful for complex education pipelines like syllabus creation, exam paper generation, or adaptive learning paths.
